                <p>
                    I am a Software Engineering student at Virtual University of Pakistan, currently in my second semester. I am passionate about web development and want to kick start my career in it. I love to create minimal websites works mostly on the details . I like to do team work but more often i go for solo mode beacuse i get a clear picture of what I need i also like team work it genrates new ideas and lots of learning. I prefer quality over quantuity.
